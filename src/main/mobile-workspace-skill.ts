Use this skill when the owner reaches Hermes from Telegram or another gateway channel to inspect, capture, or triage the SPS workspace.

## Operating Boundaries

- Treat Telegram as a remote command surface for the owner's existing SPS workspace, not as a separate mobile app.
- Prefer read-only answers for quick phone questions.
- For writes, use the existing SPS capture, task, or approval-aware tool paths. Do not bypass approvals or write directly when an approval proposal is required.
- If the desktop control helper is available, prefer \`sps task "<task text>"\` for phone task capture. It writes the guarded mobile task row; do not use raw markdown task writes for phone-created tasks.
- Phone-created tasks are review-first SPS task captures with source: telegram/mobile, route: human by default, and no context: include promotion unless the owner explicitly approves that later.
- Do not auto-message assignees or external contacts from a mobile request unless the existing task/contact flow explicitly asks for that action and approval state allows it.
- Keep responses short enough for a phone screen and include the affected page/task names.

## Workspace Map

- Vault pages are markdown files with frontmatter; markdown remains the source of truth.
- Tasks are SPS task rows, normally under the tasks scope, with status, due/due_date, assignee/assigneeId, route, and priority fields when present.
- Contacts live in the people scope and may carry email, phone, Telegram, WhatsApp, aliases, tags, and fragments.
- Daily Brief and Overnight Triage pages are review-first context; they should not be treated as injected context unless frontmatter opts in.
- Inbox captures are reviewable intake, not automatically trusted knowledge.

## Common Phone Intents

- "what's overdue?" or "what needs me?" - inspect undone tasks whose due or due_date is before or on the local date, then summarize the smallest actionable list.
- "add this as a task" - capture the text as a review-first SPS task with source: telegram/mobile and route: human unless the owner clearly asks for delegation.
- "remember this" - create a reviewable capture or memory proposal with source: telegram/mobile, not an unreviewed knowledge write.
- "who is X?" - answer from contact rows and cite the page/contact name; avoid exposing raw private fragments unless needed.
- "draft/reply/send" - prepare the draft or proposal first. Sending through external channels requires the existing explicit send/approval path.
